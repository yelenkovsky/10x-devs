## Overall concept

- GHA workflow run for every new pull request to master
- composite action for the review itself so that main workflow is easy to reason about

## Input parameters

- pull request title
- pull request description (?? cost tradeoff)
- git diff

## Code Review Criteria

Each criterion is scored on a 1–10 scale, where 1 is the worst outcome and 10 is the best.

1) **implementation correctness** — does the code actually do what it claims, handling edge cases and error paths without introducing regressions?
   - _1_: logic is broken, misses obvious edge/error cases, or silently regresses existing behavior.
   - _10_: behaves correctly across happy path, edge cases, and failure modes with no regressions.

2) **idiomaticity** — does the code follow the language, framework, and project conventions a fluent reader would expect?
   - _1_: fights the stack's idioms and the repo's established patterns, reads as foreign.
   - _10_: indistinguishable from well-written surrounding code, uses the right idioms naturally.

3) **complexity** — is the solution as simple as the problem allows, without needless abstraction or convolution?
   - _1_: over-engineered or tangled — hard to follow, with accidental complexity that obscures intent.
   - _10_: minimal and clear, the simplest design that solves the problem completely.

4) **test / risk coverage** — are the meaningful behaviors and risky paths exercised by tests proportional to their risk?
   - _1_: risky logic ships untested; tests are absent, trivial, or assert nothing useful.
   - _10_: risk-weighted coverage — the parts most likely to break are tested deliberately and well.

5) **documentation** — are non-obvious decisions, public surfaces, and tricky code explained where a reader would need it?
   - _1_: opaque — no comments or docs where they're needed, intent must be reverse-engineered.
   - _10_: just enough docs/comments to explain the "why" without restating the obvious.

6) **security and safety** — does the change avoid introducing vulnerabilities, leaking secrets, or unsafe handling of untrusted input?
   - _1_: introduces an exploitable flaw, leaks secrets, or trusts untrusted input unsafely.
   - _10_: input is validated, secrets are handled correctly, and no new attack surface is opened.

## Parked for later

- business alignment (require broader context)
- architectural fit (require broader context)

## Expected side-effects

- PR comment with summary
- labels: `ai-cr:failed` (red) OR `ai-cr:passed` (green)

## Expected behavior

- on-demand retry when label `ai-cr:review` is added
